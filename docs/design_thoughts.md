# Design Thoughts

## Priorities

## Scratch

- add loading icon for connecting to Spotify (and show error and failed)


## Completed

### Dancing Together is a good music player

1. ~~Station view for everyone~~
  - ~~album art~~
  - ~~song, artist, album~~

2. ~~When a listener joins a room, they should get up to speed with current
   playback state~~

### Dancing Together supports necessary admin controls

1. ~~Admin UI controls~~
  + ~~see list of listeners~~
  + ~~remove listeners~~

### Dancing Together is production ready

1. ~~Remove chat box~~

2. ~~Use SSL on Heroku~~

3. ~~Use bootstrap to make site prettier~~

4. ~~Fix (Home(current)) on pages (remove current text)~~

5. ~~Add SpotifyCredentials to Django admin page for user~~

6. ~~Add description and contact info~~

7. ~~Station index should show stations you already have access to~~


## Cut

### Dancing Together supports necessary admin controls

1. Admin UI controls
  + control whether listener is an admin or DJ
  + see list of pending listeners and approve/reject

2. users can search by room id and request permission

3. Invite users via email to join room
    - make link expire after 24 hours
    
4. Add stop/stream controls to join/disconnect from station for non-djs

5. show warning if non-dj tries to change music
